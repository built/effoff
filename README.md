##F-Off, indicate a feature is off/incomplete in your Bootstrap app.

#####What's going on here?
This is a set of styles to use with your Bootstrap-based application or website. This is a tool to manage user and stakeholder expectations.
Use F-Off to indicate which parts of your app are finished and which parts are still in progress.

#####How to use it

Include in your app immediately after Bootstrap and any Bootstrap theme, like so:
    <link rel="stylesheet" href="css/bootstrap.min.css">
    <link rel="stylesheet" href="css/bootstrap-theme.min.css">
    <link rel="stylesheet" href="css/foff.css">


* Option 1: foff
  Apply the foff style to any Bootstrap-styled element to give it the appearance of being mocked up.
* Option 2: fugly
  Apply the fugly style to any Bootstrap-styled element to give it a screamingly annoying appearance that says "Don't take this seriously."


#####Requirements
This style set was built against Bootstrap 3.3.1 but will likely work with versions dating back to 2.x

#####Example
See demo.html in this repo.
